Do 1 thing and do it well . Node philosophy.

Grunt Installations :
--------------------
1. grunt-cli -g : for grunt tasks on command line. globally so that its available on cmd.
2. its completely user choise to do on project level. Then we have to go to node_modules and
    then bin and open command prompt and execute tasks.
3. grunt-contrib-jshint: lint tool.
4. grunt-contrib-watch : this is mainly for restart and trigger restart.
5. Prefered way is always to start with package.json file and use --save / --save-dev
6. basic tasks like 'jshint': [project files] , 'watch':[files],task ['jshint']
    in GruntFile.js

Mocha : Testing Stratergy
-------------------------
1. Install Mocha Globally. (Can use easily from command prompt)
2. By default it search test(folder) or tests(.js) file and then keep checking for
    describe and keep executing tests.
3. Regarding tests folder , preferred way would be to have indivisual folder
       and keep addings tests to it. Easy to manage and will be faster.

Git and Git Hub :
-----------------
1. Create git ignore file, and add idea, node_modules,some other.


Concepts:
---------
1. When we import using require from node , its almost like compiling and
    executing entire file. Like basic variable decl, console statements
    will be executed.But methods will be exposed, they will not be run unless
    invoked.
2.
3.
