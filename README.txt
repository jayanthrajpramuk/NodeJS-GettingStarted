Keeping track of NODEJS components via Git

ES6 practices.

^ , ~ some of the features which are present in NPM. Check out those.

nodemon app.js : automate the changes and run

- custom script
: nom run nodemon : :) // new file

- get , post , put , delete are wrappers of node on top of regular
HTTP methods

- node for back end of Javascript. Bower for front end of Javascript

- gulp : task manager for our application.
if we get cli error , which means we are missing some libgit

- <!-- bower:js --><!--endbower-->
- <!-- bower:css --><!--endbower-->

- wiredep is to inject the libraries in to our index.html.

 - overrides is used because wiredep will not be able to identif and inject
 so we override in bower.json

 - jshint , jscs, automatic reload using gulp-nodemon, automatic js/css file insertion in index.js
